## Conclusions
- A major chunk of profit comes from just a few sub-categories. Businesses can scale earnings by focusing on Printers and Bookcases.
- COD is still dominant, but UPI and Debit Cards can be encouraged for faster settlements.
- Seasonal drops in profits (May, June) hint at promotion strategy gaps or stock issues.
- Clothing dominates in volume but doesn't appear in top profit categories, suggesting low margin or heavy discounting.

## Final Insights
- Focus marketing efforts in Maharashtra & Madhya Pradesh.
- Push high-margin sub-categories during low-profit months.
- Incentivise digital payments to reduce COD dependency.
- Optimise clothing pricing to improve profitability.
